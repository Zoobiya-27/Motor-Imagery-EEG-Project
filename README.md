# Motor-Imagery-EEG-Project
EEG-based BCI project decoding left/right-hand motor imagery using EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and CSP. Includes preprocessing, feature extraction, deep learning, traditional ML, and neurophysiological analysis for assistive tech and neurorehabilitation applications.

## Overview
EEG-based BCI system for motor imagery classification using deep learning (EEGNet, ShallowConvNet) and traditional ML (LDA, SVM). Includes neurophysiological analysis and CSP feature importance.

## Features
- Preprocessing: Bandpass, Baseline Correction, Artifact Removal
- Classification: LDA, SVM, EEGNet, ShallowConvNet
- Visualization: Training history, CSP patterns, ERD/ERS, confusion matrices
- Dataset: PhysioNet Motor Movement/Imagery Database (49 subjects)

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.8
- Packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, mne, sklearn, tensorflow

## Usage
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run script: `motor_imagery_project.ipynb'
